'Hello Everyone!'
I followed this tutorial [Build a Pokédex REPLICA with Vanilla JavaScript and the PokéAPI (Pokémon API)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXjSaZb67n8&t=252s) by Justin Kim. 
It was a really fun process and I was so surprised that I completed it in one day. 
If you're learning to JavaScript I highly recommend it! I am looking forward to adding more features in the future, but for now gotta catch 'em all.
